Chameleon System SanityCheck
============================

SanityCheck adds diagnosis capabilities to any PHP application. By defining a range of checks, it can be ensured that
requirements for running the application are met continuously. For example, available disk space, granted file
permissions or availability of remote systems can be checked.

When and where these checks are performed is up to you. In an installer, from the command line or an admin
interface - just add the checks wherever they suit your needs.
