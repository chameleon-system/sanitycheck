Installation
============

Step 1: Download the Library
----------------------------

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ composer require chameleon-system/sanitycheck "~6.0.0"

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
in the `installation chapter`_ of the Composer documentation.
Be sure to adjust the version information "~6.0.0" to the actual version you need.

If you use the Symfony framework, it is recommended to use the SanityCheckBundle instead, as it integrates with
the Symfony container and eases configuration and usage.


Step 2: Create Checks
---------------------

Create checks as described in the usage document in this documentation.
